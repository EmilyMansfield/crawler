#CRawler#

A small text-based dungeon crawler written in Ruby.

CRawler is designed to be

- Extensible. All game data is supplied via JSON files, with the program
  only handling the game engine.
- Lightweight. If it can run Ruby, it can run CRawler. After all, there aren't
  even any graphics!
- Short. If the documentation is longer than the source code, we're doing
  something right.
- Natural. No 'choose option 1 to take the dagger', CRawler uses natural
  language processing to understand simple commands, such as 'take dagger from
  my bag'.
